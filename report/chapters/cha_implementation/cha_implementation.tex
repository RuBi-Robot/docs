\chapter{Construction process} % (fold)
\label{cha:implementation}
This chapter is dedicated to explain the process of manufacturing and assembling the introduced designs.
From the important role of emerging low-cost technologies like FFF 3D printing up to the creation of custom PCBs for reducing the weight of the robot, the following sections are meant to explain the process of acquisition and construction of all the components of RuBi presented in previous chapters.
The implementation of the final prototype has always been led by criteria of security, constrained budget and feasibility for maintenance and futures improvements.

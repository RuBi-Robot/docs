In order to reduce weight and inertias, \ref{ssub:extension_pcbs} presented an extension board that interfaces between the motor and the BLDC electronics.
With a 1.8 meter long wiring used to extend the connection, the purpose of the extension PCBs are to be mounted over the joints, close enough to the motors so that their original wiring can be used, as in Figure \ref{fig:pcb2}, and transfer the signals to the motor board out of the structure, as in Figure \ref{fig:electronics1}.

New Molex connectors have been soldered to the original boards in order to implement these extensions, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:electronics2} within the final arrangement of the motor boards and the main processor board.
A distinctive color has been chosen for the wiring of each motor just to ease the task of arranging the final configuration.
Every motor board is labeled with the name of the joint it drives and matched to the appropriate address from the main processor by software, as explained in \ref{sub:ros_control_hardware_locokit_interface}.
This means that if a BLDC motor board is going to be changed, both its physical connection, label and internal address have to be changed accordingly.

All the off-board electronics has been placed over a small wooden structure to ease its use.

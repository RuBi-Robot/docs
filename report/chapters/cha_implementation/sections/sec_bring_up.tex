In order to bring up the robot, a battery has to power it and the computer must be started.
It will automatically create a Wi-Fi hotspot called \textit{RuBi} where the user can connect to.
From this moment, the robot should be able to receive motor commands.
If not, the IP in the \textit{locokit\_hw} has to be changed according to the stablished in the host.
In the guest, open a new terminal and run:

\begin{lstlisting}
roslaunch rubi_bringup rubi_bringup.launch
\end{lstlisting}

ROS Control will be loaded along with the locokit hardware interface and the controllers can move the real robot.

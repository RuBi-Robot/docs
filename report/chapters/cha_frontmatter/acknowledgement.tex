        The completion of a Master Thesis entails an amount of devotion and effort difficult to assess since its extension is not bounded to a single semester of actual work, but it comprises the process of acquisition of all the skills and knowledge applied on it.
        Thus, the task of properly acknowledging all those who somehow contributed to this moment turns out to be non-trivial.\\ 
        We have tried our best here.\\
        Our most sincere gratitude goes to our thesis supervisors JÃ¸rgen Christian Larsen and Poramate Manoonpong. 
        Their support and advice have let us write this page today.\\
        To our families correspond an embarrassingly big percentage of the credit for this thesis and all that has come before. Their unconditional encouragement and love made us find ourselves in Denmark, doing what we have always liked and being just happy.\\
        And finally, a grateful word for our friends and classmates, here and there.
        You made the whole path worth walking, guys.

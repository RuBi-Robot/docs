\chapter{Conception and initial analysis} % (fold)
\label{cha:analysis}
The process of sketching a bipedal robot as the presented here implies that the essential variables for the design have to be identified and determined aiming at the most optimal solution possible\footnote{Optimality here is measured in terms of the aimed goals, described in \ref{sec:goals}.}.
The important role of the geometrical and inertial mechanical parameters in locomotion control was first proved by \cite{passive_walking}, and their relevance deserves a careful study.
Hence, the sections in this chapter contain the conceptual presentation of a set of design criteria and the first approaches to the construction of the RuBi prototype arisen from the study of these parameters and the application of these criteria.

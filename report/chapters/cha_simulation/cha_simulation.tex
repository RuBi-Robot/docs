\label{cha:simulation}
Within the goals of the RuBi framework is the creation of software environment whose last goal is to facilitate the user the test of new controllers.
The process of testing new code in locomotion is usually slow due to the inherent problems of the hardware: maintenance, adjustments, bringing up the robot...
Which breaks the workflow of the user and forces to spend a time that should be used in the actual development of the program.
The RuBi framework includes a simulator and its simulation model in order to tackle this problem.
The sections of this chapter include from a comparison of simulators to the explanation of how to start developing controllers, passing through the creation of the robot and other tools implemented like dimensional analysis or a rotational holder for the device.
The instructions for the use of the simulation environment created are to be found in the manuals attached to this report.

\label{sec:how_to_simulate}
The actions for starting the simulation are minimal and, with everything installed, just a terminal shall be opened and the user have to insert:

\begin{lstlisting}
roslaunch rubi_gazebo rubi_world.launch
\end{lstlisting}

The launch file will load ROS Control along with the simulation.
From that moment the user can run the controllers and the legs will move equally than in the real robot.

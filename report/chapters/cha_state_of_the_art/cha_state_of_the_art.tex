\chapter{State of the art} % (fold)
\label{cha:state_of_the_art}
This chapter contains a concise overview of some of the major, and more relevant for this thesis, advances in artificial legged locomotion in the past 60 years.
A brief prelude of the emergence and evolution of natural, limb-based terrestrial motion and more in detail bipedalism is presented.
It is followed by a short introduction of some of the history and results from the union between the engineering field and the study of motion and legged systems. 
From the first, ancient mobile artifacts and prosthesis to the current, most advanced devices in robotics.
It continues with an exposition of three of the most pertinent breakthroughs in modern technologies that allowed to reach the current state of the art in modern autonomous walking robots.
And it finishes with a quick look to the future of the bipedal locomotion.

%\section{Theoretical background}



%But it has been in the last 30 years of the past century when the robotics field has started to focus on accomplishing bipedal locomotion, being the first model the WAM-1, built at Waseda University in 1967 \cite{}.
% Since this robot, the evolution of the platforms targeted at mimicking human locomotion has rapidly achieved great successes, which can be exemplified in robots as ASIMO, MABEL or BioBiped \cite{mabel}, \cite{biobiped}, %\cite{}.  
% However, even though the generation of stable walking gaits for biped platforms seems to have reached a next stage with the latest Atlas robot, the variances in kinematics, kinetics and control required for running and for the transition between the walking and running gaits still set out unsolved challenges.
% Besides, differences in energy consumption and balance control or trajectory generation still remain noticeable when comparing the performance of humanoid robots and humans \cite{h7}.

% In order to contribute to the study of stable walking and running gaits generation in bipedal robots, and aiming at providing a new tool to gain new insights on the transition between these gaits, this project offers a new robotic platform for continuing the research in these areas at the University of Southern Denmark.
% The current bipedal robot being utilized at the AI department at the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Institute to benchmark neural controllers for locomotion is the DACbot walking robot, a next generation of RunBot \cite{runbot1} \cite{runbot2}.
% The limitations of this model when trying to approach human-like gait include among others the lack of actuated ankles or compliance in other joints besides the ankles. 
% Furthermore, its fixed structure and the way it was manufactured make modifications for different experiments or even repairs a hard task.
% A new bipedal platform offering a structure easy to modify and repair, low-cost, fully actuated and whose compliant components can be reconfigured, could be a valuable instrument for future studies.
% The RuBi robot, introduced here, wants to be presented as a mean to overcome the above mentioned restrictions and provide these new features. 
% Besides, the possibilities arisen from having two different study platforms in the department include being able to test neural controllers in different robots to observe their adaption, for instance.

\subsection{Rods} % (fold)
\label{sub:rods}
As explained in section \ref{sub:bearings}, it was decided to have two bearings per link (which gives four per joint) and a rod going through them.
This rod is then also used, in the case of the knee and the ankle, as a support for the pulleys that transmit the power from the motor to the next link.

Three mechanical efforts bound its design:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Shear strength}: in the case of the shear produced when an impact occurs and the rod of one link moves in the opposite direction than its relative in the consecutive link.
  \item \textbf{Resistance to bending}: due to the bending effort that the tension of the belt is constantly applying in the rod of the  knee and the ankle.
  \item \textbf{Torsion}: due to the pulley in the knee and the ankle. 
  This effort is negligible because zero-friction bearings are supposed.
\end{enumerate}

  \subsubsection{Shear analysis} % (fold)
  \label{ssub:shear_analysis}
  The maximum shear stress is found in the diameter of the cylinder (y=0) and is:

  \end{minipage}%
  \hfill%
  \begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      \gamma_{yz} &= \frac{Q_y M_{x}^A*}{b(y) I_x} = \frac{Q}{r^2}\\
      M_{x}^{A_{y=0}} &= \frac{\pi r_1^2}{2} \\
      b(y=0) &= 2 r_1 \\
      I_x &= \frac{\pi r_1^4}{4}
      \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
  \end{minipage}
  Given a tangent force Q, the shear stress can be calculated.
  If this is over the ultimate strength, the cylinder will break.

  \subsubsection{Bending} % (fold)
  \label{ssub:bending}
  The bending analysis follows the one carried out in the section \ref{ssub:profile_study} for a cylinder.
  The equivalent force in this case is given by the tension of the belts, mainly the initial (though there are other tensions that appear when the belts moves for example).
  Due to feasibility reasons and the lack of the appropriate measurements devices, some experimental tests trying different tensions and axes where carried out giving good results with a 3 mm rod or more.

  \subsubsection{Sizing} % (fold)
  \label{ssub:sizing}
  The studies above have been tested for different diameters of rod starting from the smallest size given by the provider and increasing until both conditions are satisfied, due to the requirements of weight reduction.
  In case of using steel as material, the ultimate strength is supposed to be 250 MPa\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A36\_steel}.
  And for the case of a rod of 3 mm of diameter, both stresses are under the restrictions.
  Thus, 3 mm rods are going to be used.

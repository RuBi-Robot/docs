When approaching the task of designing a new robotic platform for the AI department at the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Institute, the current development environment being utilized and its capabilities were studied as a first step.
Nowadays, the simulation and control of the robots at the department is based on the LPZrobots \cite{lpzrobots} and Gorobots \cite{gorobots} packages.
These software tools provide both a simulation engine for robots built on ODE \cite{ode}, OSG \cite{osg} and a framework for an easy implementation of controllers in both simulation and hardware.
However, their specificity compared to other existing instruments collides with some of the core design ideas of the robot framework presented here, which are simplicity of use and generalization.
The above mentioned are the reasons why it was decided to migrate the development environment to ROS Jade \cite{ros} for the bipedal locomotion study framework of RuBy.
